## HW.27/03/24:
1) Write a mapping function that gets an array of temprature in fareneight and returns the array of tempratures in celsious.
2) implement the function reverse() (that accepts an array and returns reversed array) using: reduce() and unshift()
3) using reduce, implement a function that accepts an array and returns an object that each key:value in the object is the index:value from array (hint: the inital value of the reduce should be {}).
4) implement the function find() (that accepts an array and a condition function) - using reduce.
5) implement a function that accepts an array of objects with people details and using map() returns an array of the same objects but with additional key "hasLongName": true/false, when it is true if the person has a name with over 6 letters. example: input: [{ name: 'Adi', age: 30}, { name: 'Anastasia', age: 29}], the function should return: [{ name: 'Adi', age: 30, hasLongName: false}, { name: 'Anastasia', age: 29, hasLongName: true}]
