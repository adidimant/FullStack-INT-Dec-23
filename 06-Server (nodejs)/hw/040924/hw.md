1) Create a new server for the instagram project
2) Create a new endpoint - GET /posts
3) Migrate the api calls for the posts data to be received from the server
it means that the client side (react) will request for the posts from our server
the server will recieve the request, then will create a request for the posts API
then will response the results to the client (react)
