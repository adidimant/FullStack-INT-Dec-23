1) based on your own server, create at least 3 more endpoints that return different responses to the client
 NOTE - endpoint is defined by HTTP method + path (for example: GET '/', POST '/login')
 * one of the responses should be an array / json object - read in the internet how you response in express with an object/array
2) Establish new server on the same port - see what's happening (you don't have to write another index.js.. just opena new terminal in parralal and write again `node index.js`)
3) Read about HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
4) Read about HTTP status codes (1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
5) [Bonus] Find the commands in terminal that shows you:
  a) All the open ports
  b) All the processes that runs on specific port (for example port 80 or port 3000)
