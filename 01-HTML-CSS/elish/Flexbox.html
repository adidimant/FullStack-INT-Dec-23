Toyota was established in September 1933 as a division of the Toyoda company, which was engaged in the production of textile weaving machines. The first division manager was Kishiro Toyoda, son of Sakichi Toyoda, the company's founder. The division's first engine was developed in 1934, and the first cars (model A1 and G1) were introduced in 1935. In 1936, serial production of the first car, the AA model, began.[9]
The automobile division became a separate company and was registered under the name 'Toyota' on August 28, 1937. That same year, the company's first automobile manufacturing plant was established in the city of Kuromo, Japan. During World War II the company was mainly engaged in the production of trucks for the Japanese army including the Su-Ki amphibious truck, and its factories were not bombed by the Allies. In 1947, production of the private cars, sold under the name "Toyopet" (Toyopet), resumed. The first model sold under this name was the SA. After entering the American market, it was decided to stop using this name, because it created an association for pets (pet in English). The name continued to be used in other markets until the mid-1960s.
In 1956, the network of sales agents was established.
In 1958, sales of the company's vehicles began in the United States, which at the end of the year amounted to the sale of 287 Crown vehicles as well as one Land Cruiser SUV.[10]
In 1963, Toyota established its first factory outside of Japan in Melbourne, Australia.[11] In 1965 the company entered the field of sports cars and began sales of the "Toyota Sport 800".

The company "Kwaishinsha Motorcar Works" from Tokyo, founded in 1911, built its first car three years later called DAT, after the initials of its founders. In 1925 the name of the company was changed to DAT. This company merged with Jitsuyo Jidosha, another car manufacturer from Osaka, and in 1931 the first Datsun car was produced. In 1932 Datsun type 11 was produced. The name DATSON was created from the combination DAT and Son meaning "son", but because "Son" means "loss" in Japanese, the name was changed to DATSUN.
In 1933 the company's name was converted into Japanese as "Jidosha Seizo" and it moved to Yokohama. A year later it merged with another car manufacturer "Nihon-Sangyo" called "Ni-san" for short. This name became the company's official name in 1934. Similar to other Japanese manufacturers such as Isuzu and Hino Motors, Nissan partnered with a European car manufacturer to gain advanced design and manufacturing know-how. Nissan chose the English Austin company and began building in Japan the "Austin 7" and "Datsun 1000" models, which was based on the Austin A50.
In the 1950s, Nissan began to introduce independently designed cars. In 1967, the 4-cylinder "L" engine was introduced, which was advanced for its time and had an overhead camshaft. This engine was assembled in the new sedan Datsun 510 which was quite successful in the local and export markets. In 1970, Nissan introduced the 240Z sports car model with a six-cylinder version of the "L" engine. The extroverted design and high capabilities of the 240Z elevated Nissan to the level of a major global car manufacturer. In 1966, Nissan merged with "Prince", another Japanese manufacturer, and gained more luxurious and larger car models such as "Skyline" and "Gloria".
Nissan Model 70 Payton
With the outbreak of the oil crisis of the seventies, Nissan was one of the largest car manufacturers in the world, as its cars were mostly economical and had a small engine. The company spread around the world and established factories in Australia, Mexico, Great Britain and several factories in the United States. The plant in Australia was closed in the late 1980s due to lack of economic justification, but another plant was opened in Pretoria, South Africa.
During the 90s of the 20th century, Nissan deteriorated, its sales decreased, and the company reached the brink of liquidation. In 1999, the French Renault purchased controlling shares in Nissan and Carlos Ghosn was appointed as president. Gohan initiated the "Nissan Revival Program" (NRP) which was extraordinarily successful. Nissan returned to profitability and renewed the Nissan and Infiniti car line, which was a domestic American brand at the time. In 2001, Ghosen continued with the "Nissan 180" program for the continued growth of the company. His success in returning the company to profitability earned him great sympathy and publicity in Japan, almost to the point of national hero status, with many mentions in manga and popular culture. Emperor Akihito awarded him the Japan Medal with Blue Ribbon in 2004. One of Nissan's compact and luxury cars is the Nissan Maxima.
In 2021, Nissan introduced the seventh car in the Z series, the Nissan Z.
