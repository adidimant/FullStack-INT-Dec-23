- Build an article website, you should write some content & images
- Build a control window that is taking over the screen
- The control window is rectangle with full content, but it's background has some opacity
- Easy: the take-over window should pop-up after 7 seconds if you reading the article
- Hard: the take-over window should pop-up after scrolling 40% of current window down
- The take-over window should be nice, with css design in a separate .css file, be creative
