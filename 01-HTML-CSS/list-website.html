<!--
  Build an html website, that contains unordered list of your weekly todos (your goals for the week)
  1) define the basic css styiling for this list & list items
  2) On every item hover - the text of the item should be bold & colored in another color & add some border and background to it 
  3) On todo click - make a line over the text (search on the internet how to do it)
  [hint - you'll need a javascript code for that, and also knowing the index/id of each list item]
  4) [Bonus] - Add an input option for adding more todos & add it to the list
