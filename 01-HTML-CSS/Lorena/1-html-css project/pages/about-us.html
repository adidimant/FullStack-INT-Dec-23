      <h1>Abous Us</h1>     
      <h2>We are Nippon Rent-A-Car. Founded in 1969, Nippon Rent-A-Car is Japan's most distinguished rental car company.
        We provide customers with approximately 850 locations and 42,000 vehicles throughout Japan.
        As we are not affiliated with any specific automaker, we are able to provide a variety of vehicle makes and models for customers to rent.
        Rather than let vehicles age, we also replace our most popular passenger vehicles every few years.
        Replacing used vehicles eliminates uncomfortable wear and tear, and reduces the risk of breakdown and other inconveniences to our customers.
        The most trusted name in vehicle rentals.</h2>
