See forms reference here - https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
Your goal is to create two different forms:
1) Registration html page - filling user details information (first name, last name, birthdate, gender, address, school, food preference)
gender field should be <select> html element with two options
favourite food should be a radio html selection (search on google), the options: 1) None, 2) Vegeterian, 3) Vegan, 4) Kosher
All fields are required (search how you do it)
Except of the form - the page should contain top nav menu with links to other pages on the internet (select what you want)
2) Yad2 product publish form - contains category, subcategory, name, description, address, condition (radio selection - brand new/ like new / used / bad condition)
- Ability to upload multiple images
[Bonus] - After filling all the details in Yad2 form & pressing and "submit" button - a summary table is created
- Add a checkbox input with text "I would like to recieve an updates to my mail about this product"
Hint - use the onsubmit attribute on the form: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onsubmit.asp
