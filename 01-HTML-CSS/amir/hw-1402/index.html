            <p>Apple is best known for its game changing new product launches. The arrival of the iPod was instrumental in transforming how the world interacts and consumes music, while the launch of the iPhone marked the start of the smartphone era. It has also helped tablets and later smartwatches become must-have accessories thanks to the iPad and Apple Watch.
            </p>



            <p>And this week's announcement that the company will sell a $3,499 (£2,800) mixed-reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, from early next year, has been seen by some as a new iPhone moment.</p>
            <p>The US technology giant's first foray into mixed-reality headsets – which it has termed "spatial computing" – has been seen by some as the impetus for a new revolution in wearable technology.

            <p>But can it really succeed where so many others have failed?</p>

            <p>The history of mixed, virtual and augmented reality goggles is littered with the corpses of failed projects past. "We've seen a variety of augmented reality and virtual reality products that have been loudly hyped and failed to live up to their promise," says Mar Hicks, a historian of technology and professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>

            </p>            <p>"For the past 20 or 30 years, or since the late 80s, or early 90s, there's been this vision about virtual reality," says Sylvia Pan, professor of virtual reality at Goldsmiths, University of London.</p>

                <p>Much of the problem has been finding a use for this technology that people actually want, or even need. The immersive and interactivity augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) provide have tended to lend themselves most obviously to the gaming industry.
                </p>
    
                <p>"For the past 20 or 30 years, or since the late 80s, or early 90s, there's been this vision about virtual reality," says Sylvia Pan, professor of virtual reality at Goldsmiths, University of London. Some attempts came to market, like Nintendo's Virtual Boy, which claimed to be able to present "stereoscopic" three dimensional (3D) graphics while playing games. But the Virtual Boy suffered from being too expensive, too clunky, and not effective enough. (A second attempt at "stereoscopic" 3D, through the company's 3DS handheld games console, was downplayed by the company when promoting the console.)</p>
                <p>"There was a hype in the early 2000s, but it gradually came down," says Pan. In 2013, the excitement started once more with Oculus's Kickstarter campaign. OculusVR, a VR headset firm, was set up by Palmer Luckey, a retro game modder – tinkering with classic video games to inject new life into them.
