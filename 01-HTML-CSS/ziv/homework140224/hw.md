- Build an article website, you should write some content & images
- Build a control window that is taking over the screen
- The control window is rectangle with full content, but outside the rectangle there should be a background that has some opacity that you can see a little bit of the actual website below
- Easy: the take-over window should pop-up after 7 seconds if you reading the article
- Hard: the take-over window should pop-up after scrolling 40% of current window down
- The take-over window should be nice, with css design in a separate .css file, be creative
