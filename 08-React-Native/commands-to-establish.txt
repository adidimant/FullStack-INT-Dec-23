make sure to run Android device emulator

`npx create-expo-app`
cd to the created folder (the default is 'my-app')
`npm run android`
after the server is established - press "a" for running android

troubleshoot - if you get "something went wrong" - on the phone itself - go to main screen, uninstall the expo application, and press "a" again on the server cli
