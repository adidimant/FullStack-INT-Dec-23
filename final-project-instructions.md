React / react native application on the client side
  - The application should include: multiple screens (at least 5)
  - Prefered - context management between pages (useContext)
  - Routing for different pages, optional - conditional routing
  - use different react hooks
  - Performance - memo() on components, useMemo (on variables inside the component), useCallback() on functions declared inside a component, if no need to decalre a function in the component - declare it outside. Lazy loading for heavy screens.
CSS styling (or SCSS)
Javascript (for example event listeners, document.getElementById / getElements...)
Server - node.js (express framework)
   - Routers and correct endpoint management 
Authentication & authorization
Database integration
