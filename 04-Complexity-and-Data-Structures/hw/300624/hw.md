// HW:
// 1) Implement a search in a BST (a "find" function that gets a root and a value - and return the node where it exists)
// 2) Implement a BST insertion function (called insert()): accepting a root, and a value, and insert the value to the proper place in the tree
    // Note - the tree should remain a BST!
    // Note - you can assume that there are no duplicates in the tree
// 3) Implement a BST removal function (called remove()): accepting a root, and a value, and removes the node which has this value from the BST
    // Note - the tree should remain a BST!
