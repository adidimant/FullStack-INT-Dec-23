HW 19.05.24:
- According to the instructions above User class in lesson-5.ts:

// read about "extends" in classes in TS
// extend the Person class in the User class
// add additional User fields
// Create users, and create persons, note that when you create a new user - this user is also a person - so you need to search how you call the constructor of the parent class
// Add 2 more functions for the User class, that uses both fields from Person & User (be creative)
// implement the getRecommendedNetflixMovies & getNotSeenRecommendedMovies - you need to call the API - 'https://netflix.com/getRecommendedMovies?userId=<>'
// in the API response - there's a boolean field called 'seen', you need to filter according to it
