Define the enum TrafficLight, values: RED, ORANGE, GREEN, RED-ORANGE
Create a (very) simple html page (with js) that presents a circle with the current light
Every 5 seconds the light should change in the traffic-light
You should use the enum in order to get the possible light values for the traffic light
